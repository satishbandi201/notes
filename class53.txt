imp we should take official image directly  depends upon technoloy
mongo-DB
=======
example: if mongodb = mongodb 7 version
            java = maven

build mongo  image and conatainer
# docker build -t mongo:v1 .
# docker run -d --name mongodb mongo:v1  

mongodb official image from hub

catalogue
==========
nodejs:20 -docker hub

docker build -t catalogue:v1 .
docker run -d --name catalogue catalogue:v1
docker exec -it 2438c5c0a8bb bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health -->check the container health

check logs
# docker logs catalogue

check IP
# docker inspect catalogue

Error: {"app":"OK","mongo":false}
why bacause due to network, by default it takes docker host network
 we should create custom (bridge) network
# docker network ls

docker have 2 types of network, bridge and host. host means directly host network. bridge means docker creates seperate network interface and assign the IP address to containers..

docker default bridge network can't communicate between containers, docker always suggest to create custom brige network

#docker network create <name>
#docker network disconnect bridge catalogue -- disconnect
#docker network connect roboshop mongodb
#docker exec -it catalogue bash
#curl localhost:8080/health


redis
=====
# docker run -d --name redis --network roboshop redis:7

it take image from docker hub no need to write docker file
