/var/lib/docker --> Docker home directory

we should docker login before push
# docker login -u <username>

we should tag the image befor push
# docker tag run:v2 satishbandi33/run:v2
# docker push satishbandi33/run:v2

# docker push URL/username/image-name:version

# docker push docker.io/joindevops/label:v1

Expose
========
we can check which port is open by docker image
# docker inspect <imagename>

ENV
=====
env variables

CMD
======
it keeps container run every time ex: CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" ]
CMD instruction can be overriden, used to give argument # CMD ["google.com"]

ENTRYPOINT
=============
We can't override ENTRYPOINT, if we try to do it will override
We can use combination of CMD and ENTRYPOINT for better results, ENTRYPOINT will have command, default args can be supplied by CMD
You can always override default args through command line
used to give base command # ENTRYPOINT ["ping"]

USER 
========
we should use normal user for buidling images

# RUN useradd sivakumar
# USER sivakumar

WORKDIR
========
set the workdirectory

# RUN mkdir /tmp/workdir-demo
# WORKDIR /tmp/workdir-demo

cd will not work here so we should use work dir

build the image without cache and output
# docker build -t workdir:v1 --no-cache --progress=plain .



ARG
======= 
it is like env
ARG is build time variables, they can't be accessed inside container. ENV can be accessed build time and then inside container also
ARG instruction variables can be overriden #(--build-arg trainer=satish)

in an exceptional case ARG can be the first instruction to supply version to base OS in FROM, you cant use that version after FROM instruction
# docker build -t arg:v1 --build-arg version=8

How can you use ARG inside container?
use ENV with same variable name (watc vedio 1:05)

ONBUILD
========
others can use buid images by you?
While devloping images you can put some conditions while others are using your images...

Note:

we can't delete images if it is in use, first we should delete container or we should stop conatiners first
# docker rm -f `docker ps -a -q` (delete all containers at a time)
